    <h1 id="mainheading">Parts of Speech</h2>

      <article>

        <p>In English grammar, the eight major parts of speech are noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.</p>
        <h2>Nouns</h2>
        <p>The easy way to remember nouns is that they refer to people, places, or things. Even intangible or abstract concepts like ideas or thoughts are things. In the following sentences, the nouns are highlighted:</p>
        <p><mark class="tool__keyword">Sally</mark>
          doesn’t use an <mark class="tool__keyword">iPhone</mark>
          .
          <mark class="tool__keyword">Jared</mark>
          doesn’t eat <mark class="tool__keyword">subs</mark>
          .
          The <mark class="tool__keyword">Earth</mark>
          is not the <mark class="tool__keyword">center</mark>
          of the <mark class="tool__keyword">universe</mark>
          .</p>
        <h2>Pronouns</h2>
        <p>Pronouns are words that replace nouns: <i>I, me, she, we, they, who, that, yours, his, her,</i> etc.</p>
        <p>Pronouns need antecedents. That means that the thing (or person, or place) that the pronoun refers to needs to have been mentioned already by name somewhere earlier in the sentence or paragraph. If it’s not clear which thing the
          pronoun refers to, the reader can get quite confused.</p>
        <p><mark class="tool__keyword">I</mark>
          swam in the ocean.
          <mark class="tool__keyword">You</mark>
          swam in the ocean.
          <mark class="tool__keyword">He</mark>
          swam in the ocean.
          <mark class="tool__keyword">She</mark>
          swam in the ocean.
          <mark class="tool__keyword">It</mark>
          swam in the ocean.</p>

        <h2>Adjectives</h2>
        <p>Adjectives are descriptive words that add detail to a sentence. They can give important or necessary information (e.g., Please hand me the <mark class="tool__keyword">blue</mark>
          paper), or they can just make the sentence more interesting changes(e.g. A <mark class="tool__keyword">frigid</mark>
          wind blew around the <mark class="tool__keyword">icy</mark>
          town). Adjectives describe nouns.
          Please sew the <mark class="tool__keyword">red</mark>
          dress.
          The weather is <mark class="tool__keyword">hot</mark>
          and <mark class="tool__keyword">humid</mark>
          .
          The <mark class="tool__keyword">stuffed</mark>
          toy is <mark class="tool__keyword">fuzzy</mark>
          and <mark class="tool__keyword">round</mark>
          .</p>

            writeRandomQuote()
          </script>
        </q>

        <h2>Verbs</h2>
        <p>Verbs are action words: that’s a rather simplified explanation, but it’s the clearest one. Verbs tell you what the subject of the sentence is up to.</p>
        <p>He <mark class="tool__keyword">ran</mark>
          into the wall.
          She <mark class="tool__keyword">buys</mark>
          new shoes.
          The cat <mark class="tool__keyword">licks</mark>
          its fur.</p>
        <h2>Prepositions</h2>
        <p>Prepositions are little words that tell where or when (among other things) something is.
          The monkey is <mark class="tool__keyword">on</mark>
          his back.
          The glue is <mark class="tool__keyword">behind</mark>
          the board.
          The dreamcatcher is <mark class="tool__keyword">above</mark>
          the bed.</p>
        <h2>Conjunctions</h2>
        <p>Conjunctions are words like <i>and, but,</i> and <i>or</i> that connect concepts, clauses, or parts of sentences.</p>
        <p>I wanted to meet her there on time, <mark class="tool__keyword">but</mark>
          I got stuck in traffic.
          You can’t wear socks <mark class="tool__keyword">and</mark>
          sandals.</p>
        <h2>Interjections</h2>
        <p>Interjections are words like <i>wow</i> and <i>yay</i>. They’re sounds we make to convey extreme emotion or to create emphasis when we’re talking, sometimes when we can’t think of a good way to express ourselves. The problem with
          interjections is that they require a great deal of context to be understood. For instance, <i>hey</i> can mean <i>hello</i>, or <i>that’s great</i>, or <i>stop doing that</i>.
          <i>Hey!</i> How’s it going?
          <i>Wow!</i> Those fireworks are impressive.
          <i>Yay!</i> I passed calculus!</p>
        <h2>Verb Tenses</h2>
        <p>Verbs come in past, present, and future tenses. The past is used to describe things that have already happened (e.g., <i>earlier in the day, yesterday, last week, three years ago</i>). The present tense is used to describe things
          that are happening right now, or things that are continuous. The future tense describes things that have yet to happen (e.g., <i>later, tomorrow, next week, next year, three years from now</i>).</p>
        <p><b>Past tense</b>
          I <mark class="tool__keyword">lived</mark>
          here when I was ten.
          <b>Present tense</b>
          I <mark class="tool__keyword">live</mark>
          here now.
          <b>Future tense</b>
          I <mark class="tool__keyword">will live</mark>
          there when I am retired. </p>

        <h2>Subject-Verb Agreement</h2>
        <p>Singular subjects take singular verbs and plural subjects take plural verbs.</p>
        <p>(In this example, the subject is in bold and the verbs are italicized.)</p>
        <p>My <b>brother</b> <i>is</i> a doctor. My <b>parents</b> <i>are</i> yoga teachers.</p>
        <h2>Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement</h2>
        <p>When a pronoun replaces a noun, the noun is called an antecedent.
          On <mark class="tool__keyword">Michael’s</mark>
          first day of work, <mark class="tool__keyword">he</mark>
          was a little nervous.
          <i>Michael</i> is the antecedent and <i>he</i> is the pronoun.</p>
        <p>The antecedent doesn’t have to go before the pronoun, but in longer sentences it can be confusing to introduce the pronoun before the antecedent.
          On <mark class="tool__keyword">his</mark>
          first day of work, <mark class="tool__keyword">Michael</mark>
          was a little nervous.</p>
        <h2>Subjunctive Mood</h2>
        <p>The subjunctive is a form verbs can take to express conditions that are hypothetical or not true. It’s not a verb tense. The subjunctive form usually uses the third-person form of the verb with the ‑s dropped. When using the verb
          “to be” in the subjunctive, the present tense is be and the past tense is were.</p>
        <p>The subjunctive is used with certain expressions that imply a good or bad quality or an imperative. Often, the subjunctive verb is preceded by the word <i>that</i> (as in the phrases “it is best that,” and “it is essential that”).
        </p>
        <p>The subjunctive mood can express conditions that are not true:</p>
        <p>If I <i>were</i> queen for a day, I would eat cake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>
        <p>It can express hypothetical situations:</p>
        <p>If I <i>were</i> to design a dresser, it would be made of teak.</p>
        <p>It can be used to express wishes:</p>
        <p>I wish I <i>were</i> able to go on vacation with you.</p>
        <p>It can express commands or demands:</p>
        <p>The boss demanded that he <i>complete</i> the project or be fired.</p>
        <p>It can express suggestions:</p>
        <p>I suggest that she <i>cut</i> back on refined sugar to improve her health.</p>
